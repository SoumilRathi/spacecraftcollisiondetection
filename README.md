Abstract - As the threat of space debris grows larger, it is becoming increasingly important to develop methods to conduct spacecraft collision risk analysis, and subsequently automate spacecraft collision avoidance. To contribute towards this goal, I explored and tried to identify the most ideal method to conduct spacecraft risk analysis. In this paper, I present the result of this research, and showcase the importance of utilising Bayesian Machine Learning. A machine learning model using Bayesian Machine Learning has been trained and tested, and the results displayed.

My research paper focusus on automating spacecraft avoidance. This repository contains the data used in the paper
